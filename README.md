The website features a "code editor" theme, wherein the user is presented with an interface looking like any normal code editor. 
The one we have taken inspiration from for this project is Vim. The user can see the files on the left side of their screen, and the main code for the portfolio
website in the middle. The right side of the screen shows the output of the portfolio website, and contains a login form for inquiries.
